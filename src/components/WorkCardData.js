        text: " Implemented a Smart Parking Management System utilizing advanced camera technology and data analytics to address the growing parking challenges in Indian cities. The solution integrated real-time data from strategically placed cameras to provide up-to-date information on available parking spaces, accessible via a user-friendly mobile app for citizens. The app enabled drivers to reserve parking spots and make payments through dynamic pricing models, optimizing both space utilization and revenue generation. By balancing parking demand and supply, the system aimed to reduce traffic congestion, illegal parking, and environmental pollution. Additionally, the solution provided city administrators with predictive analytics tools to manage and finance parking infrastructure more effectively, promoting sustainable urban mobility and economic growth.
